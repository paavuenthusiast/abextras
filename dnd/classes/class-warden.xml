      <!-- <p class="flavor">A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power.</p> -->
      <p>As his footfalls touch down upon the snow, it melts around their cloven shape. He’s lived among the frozen embrace of the north for so long, sustained by the fire burning inside of him. His spear drags along the snow beside him as his pace picks up. His dark eyes suddenly glowing with a fierce amber light as he enters a full running stride. His prey lay still, staining the snow in his wake. Unwanted guests will not encroach upon his territory so long as he draws breath.</p>
      <p class="indent">Thunder booms in the distance. The dark halls of this ruined castle alight with each crack of lightning. The diminutive goblin crouches in the corner, seeming to cower from each bolt. The heavily armored adventurer steps through the hallway, each step like an echo to the storm outside. As he rounds the next corner, the small goblin pounces onto his back, unleashing an electrified energy from his finger tips that courses throughout the adventurer’s armor and brings him to his knees. The goblin cocks his fist and plunges it into a kink in the armor and knocks the adventurer out cold.</p>
      <p class="indent">Perched atop a rocky outcropping a travel worn elf gestures with her hands and summons a cloud of fog and sends it into the mountain pass with a gust of wind. The trolls who have taken up residence at the narrowest part of the pass, claiming tolls on unsuspecting travelers, are completely enveloped by the thick miasma and bewildered as to its source. The rest of the adventuring party descend on the trolls and carve them in twain, opening the passage for their contract holder.</p>
      <p class="indent">No matter their duties, no matter their creed, a warden will have honed his skill in battle alongside his attunement to the elemental power of the material plane into a force of nature. Each warden has a different take on what the natural order of things is but the one thing they have in common is a natural born ability to command the elements and an aptitude for combat.</p>
      <h4>FORCES OF NATURE</h4>
      <p>Wardens all share an innate ability to command the elements to some degree. They are durable and have a survivalist instinct as well which leads most wardens to specialize in formal combat as well, often supplementing a powerful weapon strike with an elemental edge. Beyond those basic similarities, each warden will specialize in a specific area of the battlefield. Either as a stalwart defender in the vanguard, following up the rear using ranged weaponry and spells, or skirmishing around the battlefield and using the terrain to their advantage. This combination of innate magical power and martial prowess gives the warden an edge in combat and a unique place amongst an adventuring party.</p>
      <h4>DISTANT COUSINS</h4>
      <p>Unlike a druid, a warden does not serve nature; but rather commands nature to serve them. Their power is raw and innate and does not come from a lifetime of patience and practice. They are more at home in the confine of cities than other naturalists too and often find a position of duty within the civilized world.</p>
      <p class="indent">The work of a warden is never quite done, however. They often find themselves on the move from task to task, only very rarely spending their entire life dedicated to a single cause and working to achieve its resolution.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a warden quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest score to improve your martial presence. Then make Wisdom or Constitution your next highest score depending on your place on the battlefield. Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

    <description>
      <p>At 2nd level, you’ve unlocked your natural born affinity with the elements in the form of spellcasting. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. The warden spell list will be provided at the end of this document.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Warden table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warden spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1st LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>At 2nd level, you know two 1st level spells of your choice from the warden spell list.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Warden table shows when you learn more warden spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 9th level, for example, you learn a new warden spell, which can be of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of your warden spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell references your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p class="indent">
				<b>Spell save DC = 8</b> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

    <description><p>Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction and expend a power die to add the number rolled to your AC. You can choose to do this after the creature has rolled to attack, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll hits or misses. If you choose to expend this die and the attack misses, the attacking creature takes fire damage equal your Wisdom modifier + the result of your power die</p>
